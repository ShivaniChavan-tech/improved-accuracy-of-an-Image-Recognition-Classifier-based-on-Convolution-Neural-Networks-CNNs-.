# improved-accuracy-of-an-Image-Recognition-Classifier-based-on-Convolution-Neural-Networks-CNNs-.

Building a Deep Learning model (based on Neural Networks) that provides reliable and improved accuracy of an Image Recognition Classifier based on Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs).
For comparing and contrasting, device two CNNs models:
1. A Keras Sequential model with multiple Convolution and MaxPooling layers, and
2. Make use of a pre-trained model
Establish a ‘base’ model by creating a ‘home-grown’ image classifier
 For the second, pre-trained CNNs model, use the very powerful image recognition classifier InceptionV3 model. Download the pre-trained model (inception_v3_weights.h5) from the Classes portal.
Note: H5 is a file format to store structured data, it's not a model by itself. Keras saves models in this format as it can easily store the weights and model configuration in a single file.
Both of these models should be trained and validated on the ‘Kaggle Cats and Dogs Dataset’. Download the data using this link: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/confirmation.aspx?id=54765
